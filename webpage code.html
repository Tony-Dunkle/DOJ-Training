    <title>DOJ Defense Attorney Interactive Guide</title>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals & Professional Blue -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A comprehensive sidebar navigation-based SPA. The user selects a topic from a persistent left-hand sidebar (e.g., 'Core Rights', 'Case Law Library', 'Specific Legislation'), and the main content area on the right dynamically updates. This structure is designed for rapid information retrieval and layered learning, allowing attorneys to quickly pinpoint specific legal concepts, common defenses, or case law precedents. This non-linear, topic-based navigation, enhanced with internal linking for deeper dives, transforms the original report into a dynamic, interconnected knowledge base, prioritizing user understanding and efficient task completion. -->

                            <p class="mt-4 font-semibold text-green-700">Defense Application: Suppress any statements taken from a client during a custodial interrogation where Miranda warnings were not properly given.</p>

                            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600">Statements taken without Miranda warnings are only inadmissible if the prosecution attempts to use them for incriminating purposes. LEOs are not required to Mirandize someone if they don't intend to ask incriminating questions.</p>
                            <p class="mt-4 font-semibold text-green-700">Defense Application: Argue for the suppression of any un-Mirandized statement if the prosecution attempts to introduce it, even indirectly, to incriminate your client.

                            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600">The use of deadly force to prevent the escape of an unarmed, non-dangerous fleeing suspect is an unreasonable seizure. Deadly force may only be used if the officer has probable cause to believe the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others.</p>
                            <p class="mt-4 font-semibold text-green-700">Defense Application: Challenge the use of deadly force if the client was unarmed and not posing a significant threat, arguing for suppression of evidence or charges related to an unlawful seizure.</p>

                            <p class="mt-4 font-semibold text-green-700">Defense Application: While officers can order a driver out, challenge any subsequent searches or actions if they exceed the scope of the initial lawful detention, or if the initial detention itself was unlawful.</p>

                            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600">If a search of a vehicle is being conducted with probable cause, law enforcement may inspect anything found within the vehicle if that item had the ability to conceal an item of interest, even if it belongs to a passenger.</p>
                            <p class="mt-4 font-semibold text-green-700">Defense Application: Challenge if the initial probable cause for the vehicle search was lacking, or if the item searched could not reasonably conceal the object of interest (e.g., searching a small coin purse for a large weapon).</p>

                            <p class="mt-4 font-semibold text-green-700">Defense Application: Focus challenges on whether genuine probable cause existed before the search. If probable cause was absent, the search is unlawful despite the exception.</p>

                            <li><span class="font-bold">Non-Leading Questions:</span> Generally, questions must be open-ended and not suggest the desired answer. This allows the witness to tell their story in their own words.</li>
                            <li><span class="font-bold">Scope:</span> Questions must be within the scope of the witness's personal knowledge and relevant to the facts of the case.</li>
                            <li><span class="font-bold">No Argumentative Questions:</span> Questions should seek information, not argue with the witness.</li>
                            <li><span class="font-bold">No Repeating Testimony (Asked & Answered):</span> Avoid asking questions that have already been answered.</li>
                            <li><span class="font-bold">Establish Foundation:</span> Before asking about a specific piece of evidence or event, establish that the witness has the necessary knowledge or experience.</li>
                            <li><span class="font-bold">Refresh Recollection:</span> If a witness forgets a detail, an attorney may use a document to refresh their memory, but the document itself is usually not admitted as evidence at that point.</li>

                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 text-sm">Cross-examination is when an attorney questions a witness called by the opposing side. The goal is to test the witness's credibility, expose inconsistencies, or elicit facts favorable to their own case.</p>

                            <li><span class="font-bold">Scope of Direct:</span> Questions must typically be limited to the subject matter covered during direct examination and matters affecting the witness's credibility.</li>
                            <li><span class="font-bold">Impeachment:</span> Attorneys can challenge the witness's credibility by showing inconsistencies, bias, prior convictions, or prior inconsistent statements.</li>
                            <li><span class="font-bold">No Argumentative Questions:</span> While more forceful, questions should still not be purely argumentative.</li>
                            <li><span class="font-bold">No New Evidence:</span> Generally, new evidence cannot be introduced through cross-examination unless it directly relates to the scope of direct or witness credibility.</li>
                            <li><span class="font-bold">Control the Witness:</span> Cross-examiners aim to limit the witness to "yes" or "no" answers where possible, preventing them from offering additional explanations.</li>
