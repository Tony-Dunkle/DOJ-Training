    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A comprehensive sidebar navigation-based SPA. The user selects a topic from a persistent left-hand sidebar (e.g., 'Core Rights', 'Case Law Library', 'Specific Legislation'), and the main content area on the right dynamically updates. This structure is designed for rapid information retrieval and layered learning, allowing attorneys to quickly pinpoint specific legal concepts, common defenses, or case law precedents. This non-linear, topic-based navigation, enhanced with internal linking for deeper dives, transforms the original report into a dynamic, interconnected knowledge base, prioritizing user understanding and efficient task completion. -->

                                <p class="mt-4 font-semibold text-green-700">Defense Application: Focus challenges on whether genuine probable cause existed before the search. If probable cause was absent, the search is unlawful despite the exception.</p>

                                <li><span class="font-bold">Non-Leading Questions:</span> Generally, questions must be open-ended and not suggest the desired answer. This allows the witness to tell their story in their own words.</li>
                                <li><span class="font-bold">Scope:</span> Questions must be within the scope of the witness's personal knowledge and relevant to the facts of the case.</li>
                                <li><span class="font-bold">No Argumentative Questions:</span> Questions should seek information, not argue with the witness.</li>
                                <li><span class="font-bold">No Repeating Testimony (Asked & Answered):</span> Avoid asking questions that have already been answered.</li>

                                <li><span class="font-bold">Scope of Direct:</span> Questions must typically be limited to the subject matter covered during direct examination and matters affecting the witness's credibility.</li>
                                <li><span class="font-bold">Impeachment:</span> Attorneys can challenge the witness's credibility by showing inconsistencies, bias, prior convictions, or prior inconsistent statements.</li>
                                <li><span class="font-bold">No Argumentative Questions:</span> While more forceful, questions should still not be purely argumentative.</li>
                                <li><span class="font-bold">No New Evidence:</span> Generally, new evidence cannot be introduced through cross-examination unless it directly relates to the scope of direct or witness credibility.</li>
                                <li><span class="font-bold">Control the Witness:</span> Cross-examiners aim to limit the witness to "yes" or "no" answers where possible, preventing them from offering additional explanations.</li>
